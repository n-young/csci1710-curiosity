# Curiosity Modelling - KenKen
Jed Fox and Nick Young

## Spec TODO: DELETE

For this project, we ask that you submit a README that explains your implementation. At a minimum, you should address each of the following points:

- What are you trying to model? Include a brief description that would give someone unfamiliar with the topic a basic understanding of your goal.

- Give an overview of your model design choices, what checks or run statements you wrote, and what we should expect to see from an instance produced by Sterling. How should we look at and interpret an instance created by your spec?

- At a high level, what do each of your sigs and preds represent in the context of the model? Justify the purpose for their existence and how they fit together.
